#Navigation Mesh project

An implementation of a naive hexagonal navigation mesh using [boids][1] and the [A* algorithm][2]. I used a [boilerplate][3] to help set up the project. Since three.js is continually changing at this stage, I added the libraries and API into this project just in case of future deprecation.

All of the code for this project is in [nav-mesh.js][4] and index.html.

To run this project, open the index.html in a browser, use the make file, or go [here][5].
