#Navigation Mesh project

An implementation of a naive hexagonal navigation mesh using [boids][1] and the [A* algorithm][2]. I used a [boilerplate][4] to help set up the project. Since three.js is continually changing at this stage, I added the libraries and API into this project just in case of future deprecation.

All of the code for this project is in [nav-mesh.js][3] and index.html.

To run this project, open the index.html in a browser or use the makefile.
